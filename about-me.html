          <h2>My name is Paul Francis and living a simple life saved my life</h2>

          <p><strong>I am a professional chef.</strong> I had so many things that i thought
         that i loved, but the truth was I couldn't even appreciate any of it because
          there was too much</p>
          <p>Things were terrible. I had a job that I hated, a home that I didn't want to
            live in, and I couldn't hold a relationship.</p>
             <hr>
             
            <h3>How I turned things around</h3>
            <p><strong>I was on a verge of a breakdown when I  got rid of everything</strong>. 
            I literally put 90% of my possessions in the garbage, sold my place and moved into
          a smaller apartment, and I quit my job.</p>
          <p>It wasn't at all, but everything About me was in such a bad place, I didn't 
            know what else to do. And it worked.</p>
            <hr>

            <h3>How I lived the simple life</h3>
            <p>Now that I'm living a simple life, things are so much better. I'm less  stressed,
               enjoy life and work more, and I have more free time to enjoy.</p>
               <p>With how much it turned my life around <strong>i felt like i had no choice than to share how i did it</strong>,
                and how others can benefit from living a simple life as well, which is why i started this site.</p>
